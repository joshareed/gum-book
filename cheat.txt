# Step 1: Make our first domain change

1. Add a published flag

2. Generate the diff
> grails dbm-gorm-diff add_published_flag.groovy

3. GOTCHA 1: discuss the implication of dbCreate="update" vs dbCreate="none"

4. Set our data sources to dbCreate="none"

5. Drop our database
> dropdb gum_books_dev; createdb gum_books_dev

6. Try running the app -- should fail with no schema

7. Run dbm-update
> grails dbm-update

8. App should now run but blow up on the published flag.  Comment it out and the app should run.  Uncomment.

9. Re-run diff and compare to before
> grails dbm-gorm-diff add_published_flag.groovy --add

10. App should run but still blow up on the published flag.

11. GOTCHA 2: not nullable columns with existing data

12. Manually edit the changelog to include a default value.	 Re-run dbm-update.

13. Run-app and inspect the database changes

14. Configure the migration plugin to run on startup
>> Config.groovy
> grails.plugin.databasemigration.updateOnStart = true
> grails.plugin.databasemigration.updateOnStartFileNames = ['changelog.groovy']

15. Re-run scaffolding
> grails generate-all gum.books.Book
